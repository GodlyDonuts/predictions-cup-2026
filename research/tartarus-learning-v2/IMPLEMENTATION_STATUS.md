# Tartarus implementation status — October 21, 22:47 UTC

R76 is installed as sole worker 1041499 at 22:44:13 UTC and is restoring the original ledger; fresh trading is not yet verified. It combines batched read-only exit selection with R75's exact no-HTTP repeat-entry recovery. The original 481 fills, 2,601,300,909-byte financial prefix, native engine and known open order 20540 were preserved at the quiet replacement boundary. The worker and reference updater are alive with no STOP at 22:47 UTC. [Installation evidence](r76-hint-batch-installed-20261021.json), [implementation and remaining verification](hint-batch-r76-20261021.md).

Focused ChatGPT turnover research is complete. A file-only FIFO/bid-depth census is queued for R76; the dated first sample did not identify an ask-relative pricing miss. A separate exact-byte recorder change reduced isolated recorder time63.45%, but remains undeployed and is not a trading-rate claim. [Economic requirements, evidence and experiment](turnover-economics-20261021.md).

The last completed trading audit remains R74 at 22:32 UTC: two new filled buys acquired 19,992 shares for 16,821.97 SUSQies, leaving cash 10,838.09 and original owned cost 85,031.82. These purchases are not realized profit. Today had 14 distinct first-filled orders and 481 partial receipts. **The minute-fill objective remains unmet: two distinct first-filled orders in 15 minutes.** [Original receipts/FIFO/cadence](r74-turnover-20261021.json). R74's post-intent validation improvement was measured; R76's overall speed and economic results are pending live verification.


This is the current summary. [All previous implementation notes are preserved](IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS_HISTORY_20261021.md).

Execution priority is one distinct filled order/minute, currently unmet. All12 recurring policies have committed, confirmed21:42:35UTC. ChatGPT Deep Research is complete. A file-only census found expired forecasts despite available external data; the boundary-aligned continuous updater is now installed without restarting R72, and fresh forecasts for all12 active targets committed at21:35:16UTC. R73’s indexed cache is included in R74. The latest audited993YES sale realized+221.355SUSQies on one filled order; this is not whole-account profitability. These changes make no new claim about ML qualification. [Research and current applied fixes](turnaround-research-results-20261021.md).

Historical R72 was verified live at 20:36:52 UTC as sole worker 1031505 (replaced by R74 at22:02UTC), with real-time subscriptions connected and no STOP. Its original 452 fills and complete 2,564,024,854-byte financial prefix match. All12 active repeat-acquisition policies were committed before replacement. [Fresh live proof](r72-fresh-live-20261021.json).

## Running and queued work

GPU population037 remains active (process18116 verified at20:20UTC). A newly completed second member in island001 produced-10.56343% nominal marked ROI and+0.0030525% stressed marked ROI on the two-day development window. Its minimum daily-growth reward is-0.13955066; it is not a profitable usable checkpoint. The two stochastic cases took145/102decisions and produced15/2fills, with no realized FIFO gain. All new fills in those cases were BUY_NO, so effective exits remain a weakness. [Original-result digest and metrics](population-037-second-member-result-20261021.json).

Continuation040 is queued on helper2288 for the original trainer18116. It replaces039 before any039 launch. Each island's latest completed generation, learned hyperparameters and all original checkpoints are preserved before migration. New040 training has not started. [Exact queue/source pins](population-040-queued-20261021.json).

The queued source includes:

- Founder evaluation/retention, so a worse first trained generation cannot erase its stronger starting policy.
- Family-conditioned target attention: BUY and SELL can learn different market preferences. The3072-parameter zero-initialized extension preserves old behavior at installation and imposes no action/quantity restriction.
- 64-transition compute chunks and equivalent source-validation improvements.
- Ownership transfer of fresh built-in historical responses, avoiding redundant deep copies. Generic/custom providers retain defensive snapshots.39 focused checks pass; four matched fitting-hour runs have identical complete observation/action/request/receipt/financial hashes and1.040x measured collection speedup. [Benchmark](owned-history-replay-benchmark-20261021.json).

[Target-selection implementation and model audit](family-target-query-20261021.md), [founder retention](founder-retention-20261021.md).

Optional process-based evolution evaluation is checked on sourcee0d83619 but disabled.22 unique focused checks cover behavior, clocks, finance and isolation. In four interleaved CPU passes over a five-minute development slice, all observations/actions/complete results matched, but child processes took154.12s median versus116.24s locally (32.6% slower). This measured result does not justify changing active037 or queued040. No optimization or independent test was run. [Benchmark and exact limits](process-evaluation-benchmark-20261021.json).

## Results and limits

The2,768-update checkpoint completed the full October17–19 development window at-4.3489075% nominal/-4.93724% stressed marked ROI. Its minimum daily-growth reward remains worse than the matched founder. The first island's final2,773-update checkpoint is a different checkpoint and its final evaluation is pending. [Later-checkpoint result](population-037-later-result-20261021.json).

The separate fitting-hour behavior audit found large orders, long uninterruptible waits, and SELL choices against markets with zero delivered holdings. API-defined complement conversion turned those SELL attempts into BUYs; it was not learning effective exits. This motivated family-dependent target selection rather than restricting legal choices. [Behavior evidence](population-037-fit-behavior-20261021.json).

Three venues provide information; execution is SIG-only. Requests, receipts, virtual clocks, modeled inference latency and rate budgets are explicit. The model can select all implemented raw API action families, quantities, prices, builder operations and waits. Software checks do not establish full API parity, calibrated real execution or profitable trading skill.

Current detailed development is2 fitting days plus2 development days. Full competition execution history and the requested4+4 evaluation chronology remain incomplete. ProtectedOctober21–25 has not been consumed. No learned model is deployed or independently profitable.

Production is separate from ML. The latest official marked equity remains the 20:16:40 observation of 94,780.155 SUSQies, down 5.22% from the start. R70's last three filled sell orders realized a net loss of 105.925; no whole-account profit is established. [Current production state](../../docs/CURRENT_STATE.md).
