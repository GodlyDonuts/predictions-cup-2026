# Moloch / Tartarus — SIG Predictions Cup 2026

Moloch is the sole official-account execution worker. Tartarus is the offline population-learning system under development. The contest uses nonredeemable SUSQie points. Source is published directly to `main`; no PR workflow is used.

## Current state — October 22, 03:49 UTC

R82 is verified live from **03:31:23 UTC** as sole worker **1062136**, updater1062139. Checked source `4d40138bb30e38a7e7aafa4e9a12036f86167faf`, binary `336de3c97e6d`. All504 prior receipts and the full2,665,626,172-byte financial prefix were reverified unchanged. [Fresh-live proof](research/tartarus-learning-v2/r82-fresh-live-20261022.json).

**The one-distinct-filled-order-per-minute target remains unmet.** R82’s15-minute window ended03:46:29 with one filled SELL:2,000YES865 at0.875, realizing **10SUSQies** against original FIFO. Two partial receipts count as one physical order. Original receipt/FIFO checks pass. [Complete cadence](research/tartarus-learning-v2/r82-cadence-window-20261022.json), [receipt audit](research/tartarus-learning-v2/r82-turnover-window-20261022.json).

R82’s post-activation SELL facts now produce accepted orders and an actual profitable sale. All12 observed candidate sweeps still stopped after one pass; median scope interval was58.485seconds. R83 is qualified to continue after exact never-attempted local draft retirements, with244 worker checks passing and unchanged runtime/native libraries. It is not yet installed. [Measured bottleneck and R83](research/tartarus-learning-v2/local-retirement-sweep-r83-20261022.md).

At02:05:32 UTC, bounded online archival retained16.196GB of cold SDK history losslessly in287.5MB of verified archives, leaving17.018GB available. Each original was decoded and rehashed before its raw duplicate was removed. The active worker was **not paused or restarted**; current/open generations and financial history were untouched. Seven real archival checks passed. [Archive evidence](research/tartarus-learning-v2/r80-cold-archive-20261022.json). Earlier cleanup removed only unused reproducible test binaries. [Cleanup inventory](research/tartarus-learning-v2/r80-disposable-tests-cleanup-20261022.json).

At03:46:29, reconciled cash is **10,094.995**, remaining original cost **85,853.90**, total attributed realized **368.98** including inherited76.52. These are not equity. Earlier separate official receipts mark **94,219.545 SUSQies**, down **5.780455%** from100,000; their exact clocks are retained and they predate the newly reconciled sell. Marks are not executable liquidation. [Official aggregates](research/tartarus-learning-v2/r82-latest-account-20261022.json).

The human targets at least **one distinct filled order per minute**, measured by first execution rather than repeated partial receipts. The latest retained official marked-account observation is linked above; earlier observations below are historical. [Execution objective and economics](research/tartarus-learning-v2/filled-minute-20261021.md).

Repeat acquisition is activated for all12 reviewed markets, confirmed21:42:35UTC. ChatGPT Deep Research is complete. Its file-only opportunity census uncovered expired forecast reviews caused by reload requests timing out in the busy worker queue. The corrected boundary-aligned updater is installed without restarting trading; fresh forecasts for all12 active targets committed at21:35:16UTC. R73’s indexed cache is included in R74. [Research findings and applied corrections](research/tartarus-learning-v2/turnaround-research-results-20261021.md).

Historical R72 was verified live at 20:36:52 UTC as sole worker 1031505 (replaced by R74 at22:02UTC), with real-time subscriptions connected and no STOP. Its original 452 fills and complete 2,564,024,854-byte financial prefix were independently verified. Binary 1cf47b2ae833, control a7a6dcacf0d8, native/runtime libraries and all 24 engine approvals are unchanged. [Exact installation](research/tartarus-learning-v2/r72-stream-join-installed-20261021.json). The subscription-startup fix is documented [here](research/tartarus-learning-v2/stream-join-r72-20261021.md).

R70 resumed actual execution before replacement:19new official fill receipts across three sell orders moved14,762shares and realized-105.925SUSQies. At the earlier R70 boundary, today UTC had11distinct filled orders. The20:16:40official snapshot is94,780.155SUSQies (-5.22% from100,000): cash24,455.475 and marked positions70,324.68. Increased activity is established; account growth is not. Marks are not guaranteed liquidation proceeds.

GPU population037 is still running. The latest fully evaluated checkpoint is unprofitable. Continuation040 is queued with founder retention, family-specific market selection,64-transition PPO batches and an equivalent replay-copy optimization. No learned model is deployed; no independent positive ROI is established.

Both external feeds are active:237 Kalshi tickers and378 Polymarket outcome books. A separate process-based evaluation experiment preserved exact behavior but took32.6% longer in its measured CPU window; it stays disabled.
