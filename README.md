# Moloch / Tartarus — SIG Predictions Cup 2026

Moloch is the sole official-account execution worker. Tartarus is the offline population-learning system under development. The contest uses nonredeemable SUSQie points. Source is published directly to `main`; no PR workflow is used.

## Current state — October 21, 20:14 UTC

R71 stopped at 20:06:41 UTC after original-ledger restoration with `LIVE_STREAM_JOIN_FAILED`; it did not reach fresh trading. The old worker discarded the specific startup cause. Source inspection found that public market broadcasts may legally arrive between market and private-account JOIN acknowledgments, while the worker required its first message to be the combined JOIN. R72 buffers those messages until both channels join, records typed failure reasons and retries transient subscription failures through the existing persisted connection budget. Five focused checks and the optimized replacement build pass; installation is next. Native engine, original452fills and financial state are unchanged. Repeat-entry version3 opt-in is still pending. [Repair and evidence](research/tartarus-learning-v2/stream-join-r72-20261021.md).

R70 resumed actual execution before replacement:19new official fill receipts across three sell orders moved14,762shares and realized-105.925SUSQies. Today UTC has11distinct filled orders. The latest19:48:09official snapshot is94,678.645SUSQies (-5.32% from100,000): cash24,455.475 and marked positions70,223.17. Increased activity is established; account growth is not. Marks are not guaranteed liquidation proceeds.

GPU population037 is still running. The latest fully evaluated checkpoint is unprofitable. Continuation040 is queued with founder retention, family-specific market selection,64-transition PPO batches and an equivalent replay-copy optimization. No learned model is deployed; no independent positive ROI is established.

Both external feeds are active:237 Kalshi tickers and378 Polymarket outcome books. A separate process-based evaluation experiment preserved exact behavior but took32.6% longer in its measured CPU window; it stays disabled.
